# GarbageSort++
# ‚ôªÔ∏è GarbageSort+ | Smart Waste Classifier & Eco-Score Analyzer

GarbageSort+ is a smart, AI-powered web application that helps users identify and classify garbage into six categories‚Äî**cardboard, paper, glass, metal, plastic, and trash**‚Äîusing image recognition and deep learning. It also provides an **eco-score** to assess the recyclability of the waste item, making it ideal for sustainability education, smart city projects, and environmental research.
